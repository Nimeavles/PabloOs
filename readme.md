# How to create your own OS from Scratch?

[**Github Repo to follow**](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial)

To tell you the truth, at this moment, I don't know anything about how a OS works.
I mean, when I say anything, is just the basics.

Some resources, can be:
- [Os-dev Book](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)
- [Bootloader](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/what-is-a-bootloader/)
